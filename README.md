# Machine learning and data science explorations

### Description

Here you will find my explorations in the fields of machine learning, data science and complex math heavy algorithms. After working as a developer for more than 8 years I've started becoming curious about topics beyond the daily code writing. I've kicked it off with an awesome machine learning module in [Software University](https://softuni.bg/modules/42). It took me 8 months in 2018 to finish all courses in the module for which I got certified too:

* [Math Concepts for Developers](https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/55425/210445c6)
* [Data Science](https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/56994/54f98910)
* [Machine Learning](https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/58497/d31e356e)
* [Deep Learning](https://softuni.bg/certificates/details/61430/5895cd25)

This gave me a solid foundation and knowledge how math and programming intersect in the fields of data science and machine learning. I was able to learn about some of the latest concepts and approaches in solving problems via machine learning including deep learning with TensorFlow.

### Projects

The explorations are split into small projects. Each one contains a main Jupyter Notebook with all of the findings and a bunch of optional helper scripts. Feel free to check them out:

* [Perlin noise - оrigin, аpplication, implementation and demonstration](01-perlin-noise/perlin-noise.ipynb)
* [To brew or not to brew - exploring beers (craft, homemade and in-store)](02-to-brew-or-not-to-brew/to-brew-or-not-to-brew.ipynb)
